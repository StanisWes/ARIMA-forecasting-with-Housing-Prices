# ARIMA-forecasting-with-Housing-Prices
Building ARIMA models to forecast housing prices for various nearby zip codes

This is a python script to forecast median housing sale prices using an ARMIA model. Jupyter Notebook was used for this and downloading Anaconda is recommended. 

The data comes from the website Zillow. Certain zip codes of interest were used in these models, but can be replaced by any zip code within the dataset.

The analysis begins by transforming the time-series data and checking if it is stationary, then proceeds to the ARIMA models. A PDF file with visualizations of the outputs from the ARIMA model is added.
